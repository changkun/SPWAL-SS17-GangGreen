In our society electronics play a crucial role in everyday life. From smartphones to simple lightbulbs, technology can be found everywhere. As such, the topic
of electronic e-waste is becoming more and more important, as the amount of discarded and obsolete electronics is steadily increasing. 

Currently most of the e-waste in the first world is exported to third world countries instead of recycling it. 
A major cause for this, is the lack of recycling opportunities in the associated countries and the absence of initiative to do so. 

We propose an ingredient list similar to food items for electronic devices, tax hierarchy and prevention mechanism. Those ensures a foundation to successfully collect and recycle e-waste.
This ingredient list will be released by the products' companies, which showcases a list of all raw resources used in making the product.
