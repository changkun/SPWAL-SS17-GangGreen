One way to reduce e-waste is by successfully recycling outdated devices. There have been many proposals for this.
For example, Kahhat et al. introduced a system similar to the ``bottle bill", which enforces recycling. A consumer has to pay
an additional deposit when buying new devices, which are returned on successful return \cite{kahhat2008exploring}.
