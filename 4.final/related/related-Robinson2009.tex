Robinson \cite{Robinson2009} pointed out that most of the E-waste is not even getting collected and just thrown into the household waste. 80\% of the E-waste which got collected is then getting exported in poor countries. The recycling in these countries is problematic because E-waste contains lots of environmental contaminants and the facilities doesn't take proper care of this. This is why these contaminants are found around these premises. E-waste has already caused a "`considerable environmental degradation"'\cite{Robinson2009} in these countries. Also the workers are suffering from health problems because barely protected against the dangerous fluids and gasses.
