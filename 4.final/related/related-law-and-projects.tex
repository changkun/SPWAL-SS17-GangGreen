According to the current European WEEE-directive, manufacturers, sellers and distributors need to 
provide a return point for electronical and electrical devices. The aim is amongst others the reinforcement 
of recycling upon responsibility of the producer, which are also in charge of bearing the costs, while the 
end consumer has the responsibility of proper waste separation \cite{EURLEX}. Specifically for smartphones, 
the German Goverment rejects a deposit at the expense of the final consumer on the national implementation \cite{BMUB}. 
There are also existing several non-profit projects, which accept mobile phones in order to reuse and recycle them \cite{NABU, DUH}.
