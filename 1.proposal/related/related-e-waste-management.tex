	\section*{Key Points}
	
	People are facing a hazardous problem in the modern era, more specifically saying, there are 20-50 million tons of e-waste being produced per year around the world, and this trend is still keeping going up. 
	
	The e-waste originally appeared in the developed countries, but now expanded to the developing countries, even less developed countries, which brings them both advantage and disadvantage.
	
	The reason why e-waste has such contradictory traits mainly lies on the two aspects of e-waste, which are supposed to be treated respectively:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Poisonous parts in the e-waste.(disadvantages)
		\item Valuable parts in the e-waste.(advantages)
	\end{itemize}
   Therefore, how to maximize the advantages, meanwhile minimize the disadvantage becomes a priority for those suffering countries.
   
   Traditional ways to deal with e-waste will consist of four procedures: Recycling, Landfills, Composition of e-waste, and Security issues.
   The paper also provides several approaches: Life Cycle Assessment, Material Flow Analysis, Multi-Criteria Analysis , Extended Producer Responsibility, Health Implications.
   
   A good management system should apply above approaches into procedures. How can we innovate over the traditional method and put forward a more scientific and efficient way could be a interesting proposal for our final project.
